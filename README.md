- In the Image_Binaries folder you can find:
    - the applications' images (bootstrap, bootloader, local_demo_vit and local_demo_dsmt)
    - the audio files that will be programmed in flash
    - the binary containing the audio files (file_system) is automatically generated and added into the folder when running the script

<img src="docs/image-115.png" width=650> <br/><br/>

> [!NOTE]
> Do not move the jumper when the board is powered on.

- After powering off the board, put the board in **serial downloader mode** by moving jumper **J61** to connect **pins 2 and 3** (towards the buttons)

<img src="docs/image-15.png" width=650> <br/><br/>

    - [https://putty.org/](https://putty.org/)
- Serial connection settings are the ones below (COM port will need to be adapted accordingly):

<img src="docs/image-12.png" width=450> <br/><br/>

### 3.8 Step 8

Download project libraries

All libraries used in the SVUI project can be found in a zip file under the name **sln_svui_iot_libs.zip** on the solution page on [nxp.com](https://www.nxp.com/mcu-svui). After downloading, unzip the libraries and add them to the desired project, sln_svui_iot_local_demo or sln_svui_iot_aec_demo, in the **libs** folder.

After adding the files, the content for the **sln_svui_iot_local_demo/libs** or **sln_svui_iot_aec_demo/libs** should look as in the image below:

<img src="docs/image-165.png" width=300> <br/><br/>

### 3.9 Step 9

DSMT production and evaluation libraries

> [!NOTE]
> For DSMT integration, there are 2 libraries included: the production lib_sln_asr and the evaluation lib_sln_asr.
>
> The sln_asr_production lib is found in the **sln_svui_iot_libs.zip** file together with the rest of the libraries.
>
> The sln_asr_evaluation lib needs to be downloaded separately from the solution page on [nxp.com](https://www.nxp.com/mcu-svui).
>
> The production library works only on RT106C.
>
> The dev kit is based on RT106V.
>
> In order to have the DSMT project working on RT106V, one must use the evaluation lib_sln_asr.
>
> The lib must be used for evaluation only and not for going into production as this will break the redistribution terms.

In order to link with the production lib_sln_asr, one must:
1. Copy libsln_asr_production.a in sln_svui_iot_local_demo/libs folder.
2. Right click on the sln_svui_iot_local_demo MCUXpresso project, select Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> MCU Linker -> Libraries.
3. Add the sln_asr_production entry.
4. Build the DSMT project.

When using the libsln_asr_production.a, for going into production with RT106C, please do not forget to set USE_DSMT_EVALUATION_MODE to 0 in app.h.

In order to link with the evaluation lib_sln_asr, one must:
1. Copy libsln_asr_evaluation.a in sln_svui_iot_local_demo/libs folder.
2. Right click on the sln_svui_iot_local_demo MCUXpresso project, select Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> MCU Linker -> Libraries.
3. Add the sln_asr_evaluation entry.
4. Build the DSMT project -> now it should run successfully on the smart voice dev kit.

### 3.10 Step 10

VIT speech-to-intent and commands libraries

> [!NOTE]
> VIT offers two types of voice detection engines: one of them used for detecting only predefined commands and the other one 
> being able to detect intents thus offering a lot more flexibility.

The following VIT libraries are found in the **sln_svui_iot_libs.zip** file on the solution page [nxp.com](https://www.nxp.com/mcu-svui):
- VIT_CM7_Production_v06_03_01 for **sln_svui_iot_local_demo** with the speech-to-intent engine
- VIT_CM7_v04_08_01 for **sln_svui_iot_local_demo** with the VIT engine
- VIT_CM7_v04_10_00 for **sln_svui_iot_aec_demo**

> [!NOTE]
> The models from **sln_svui_iot_local_demo** project were originally created for the VIT_CM7_v04_08_01 lib version. This is the reason for which we use different libs in **sln_svui_iot_local_demo** and **sln_svui_iot_aec_demo** projects.

Depending on the desired demo and engine combination, the user needs to download the specific library from the solution page and then follow the steps below.

In order to link the speech-to-intent VIT library, one must:
1. Copy VIT_CM7_Production_v06_03_01.a in sln_svui_iot_local_demo/libs folder.
2. Right click on the project you want to use the speech-to-intent VIT library for, meaning the **sln_svui_iot_local_demo** MCUXpresso project, select Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> MCU Linker -> Libraries.
3. If there is already an entry for the other VIT libraries, replace it with the VIT_CM7_Production_v06_03_01. Otherwise, simply add the VIT_CM7_Production_v06_03_01 entry.
4. Select S2I ASR in app.h and build the project.

In order to link the commands VIT library, one must:
1. Copy VIT_CM7_v04_08_01.a for **sln_svui_iot_local_demo** or VIT_CM7_v04_10_00.a for **sln_svui_iot_aec_demo** in sln_svui_iot_local_demo/libs folder.
2. Right click on the project you want to use the commands VIT library for, either the **sln_svui_iot_local_demo** or the **sln_svui_iot_aec_demo** MCUXpresso project, select Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> MCU Linker -> Libraries.
3. If there is already an entry for the other VIT libraries, replace it with VIT_CM7_v04_08_01 for **sln_svui_iot_local_demo** or with VIT_CM7_v04_10_00 for **sln_svui_iot_aec_demo**. Otherwise, simply add the corresponding entry for each demo.
4. Select VIT ASR in app.h and build the project.

> [!NOTE]
> We encourage you to always use the latest VIT lib when generating new models.

### 3.11 Step 11 (Optional, only when you want to use Visual Studio Code)

### 5.2 What is the memory usage for SVUI?

<img src="docs/image-172.png" width=900> <br/><br/>

### 5.3 What is the CPU usage for SVUI S2I + Matter?

<img src="docs/image-170.png" width=900> <br/><br/>

### 5.4 What is the memory usage for SVUI + Matter?

<img src="docs/image-171.png" width=900> <br/><br/>

### 5.5 What is the power consumption for SVUI?

Regarding power consumption of our Smart Voice solution:
1. We leverage Voice Seeker's VAD feature to go to a lower power state after a period of inactivity. In our latest code base we go to low power after 10 seconds of inactivity.
2. During low power we bypass ASR processing.
3. We switch from 528MHz to 66MHz for I2S implementation and to 75MHz for PDM implementation (we need more MIPS for PDM case since the decimation is done in software).
4. We backup latest 450ms of audio and after going to normal running mode we process those first.

With these optimizations we have the following (for the entire board, not for MCU only):
- 320mW for normal running mode
- 160mW for low power mode

The SOC (RT106V) power usage is the same as for a regular RT1062. Based on AN12245:

<img src="docs/image-188.png" width=800> <br/><br/>

At 528MHz, minimum power usage at 25 degrees Celsius would be 174mW.
The estimated minimum power usage at 75MHz is 30-40mW.

### 5.6 What are the recognition results for SVUI?

With NXP VIT S2I:
Wake word recognition: > 99% of wake words understood under silence, external kitchen noise and external music noise tests.
Expressions recognition: > 98% of expressions recognized in silence and external kithen noise. > 84% of expressions recognized for external music noise tests.
False triggers: 5 in 24 hours of English news playback.

With NXP VIT:
Wake word recognition: 97% of wake words understood under silence, 96,5% under external kitchen noise and 96% under external music noise tests.
Commands recognition: 96.5% of commands recognized in silence, 96% under external kitchen noise and 89% under external music noise tests.
False triggers: 6 in 24 hours of English news playback, 6 in 24 hours of German news playback, 1 in 24 hours of French news playback, 6 in 24 hours of Chinese news playback.
